# Testing Express

This example shows how to implement integration tests using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client). It uses a [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) database.

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and navigate into the project directory

Download this example:

```
npx try-prisma@latest --template orm/testing-express --install npm --name testing-express
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```
cd testing-express
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/orm/testing-express
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Create a new [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/overview) database by executing:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

If you don't have a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) account yet, or if you are not logged in, the command will prompt you to log in using one of the available authentication providers. A browser window will open so you can log in or create an account. Return to the CLI after you have completed this step.

Once logged in (or if you were already logged in), the CLI will prompt you to:
1. Select a **region** (e.g. `us-east-1`)
1. Enter a **project name**

After successful creation, you will see output similar to the following:

<details>

<summary>CLI output</summary>

```terminal
Let's set up your Prisma Postgres database!
? Select your region: ap-northeast-1 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
? Enter a project name: testing-migration
✔ Success! Your Prisma Postgres database is ready ✅

We found an existing schema.prisma file in your current project directory.

--- Database URL ---

Connect Prisma ORM to your Prisma Postgres database with this URL:

prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=...

--- Next steps ---

Go to https://pris.ly/ppg-init for detailed instructions.

1. Install and use the Prisma Accelerate extension
Prisma Postgres requires the Prisma Accelerate extension for querying. If you haven't already installed it, install it in your project:
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate

...and add it to your Prisma Client instance:
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate"

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

2. Apply migrations
Run the following command to create and apply a migration:
npx prisma migrate dev

3. Manage your data
View and edit your data locally by running this command:
npx prisma studio

...or online in Console:
https://console.prisma.io/{workspaceId}/{projectId}/studio

4. Send queries from your app
If you already have an existing app with Prisma ORM, you can now run it and it will send queries against your newly created Prisma Postgres instance.

5. Learn more

Locate and copy the database URL provided in the CLI output. Then, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Now, paste the URL into it as a value for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. For example:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...
```

Run the following command to create tables in your database. This creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Execute the seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) to populate your database with some sample data, by running:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. Start the REST API server

Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and execute this command to start the server:

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can send the API requests implemented in `index.js`, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/feed`](http://localhost:3000/feed).

### 4. Testing the endpoints

The tests are located in the `tests` folder. In these you will find tests handled for cases if a same user is added twice and also to check if the users added are obtained correctly.

The tests can be run using:

```
npm test
```

## Using the REST API

You can access the REST API of the server using the following endpoints:

### `GET`

- `/user`: Fetch all users

### `POST`

- `/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user


## Switch to another database (e.g. SQLite, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than Postgres, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block.

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### Remove the Prisma Client extension

Before you proceed to use your own database, you should remove the Prisma client extension required for Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
npm uninstall @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Remove the client extension from your `PrismaClient` instance:

```diff
- const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
+ const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### Your own PostgreSQL database

To use your own PostgreSQL database remove the `@prisma/extension-accelerate` package and remove the Prisma client extension.

### SQLite

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add the SQLite database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db""
```

### MySQL

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add a MySQL database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
## This is a placeholder url
DATABASE_URL="mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add a Microsoft SQL Server database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
## This is a placeholder url
DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
```

### MongoDB

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add a local MongoDB database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
## This is a placeholder url
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```
