# Fullstack Example with Nuxt & Prisma Postgres (REST API)

This example shows how to implement a **fullstack app with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org//)** using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (frontend) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend). It uses a [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) database.

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and navigate into the project directory

Use the `try-prisma` CLI to download this example:

```terminal
npx try-prisma@latest --template orm/nuxt --install npm --name nuxt
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```terminal
cd nuxt
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/orm/nuxtjs
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Create a new [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/overview) database by executing:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

If you don't have a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) account yet, or if you are not logged in, the command will prompt you to log in using one of the available authentication providers. A browser window will open so you can log in or create an account. Return to the CLI after you have completed this step.

Once logged in (or if you were already logged in), the CLI will prompt you to:
1. Select a **region** (e.g. `us-east-1`)
1. Enter a **project name**

After successful creation, you will see output similar to the following:

<details>

<summary>CLI output</summary>

```terminal
Let's set up your Prisma Postgres database!
? Select your region: ap-northeast-1 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
? Enter a project name: testing-migration
✔ Success! Your Prisma Postgres database is ready ✅

We found an existing schema.prisma file in your current project directory.

--- Database URL ---

Connect Prisma ORM to your Prisma Postgres database with this URL:

prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=...

--- Next steps ---

Go to https://pris.ly/ppg-init for detailed instructions.

1. Install and use the Prisma Accelerate extension
Prisma Postgres requires the Prisma Accelerate extension for querying. If you haven't already installed it, install it in your project:
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate

...and add it to your Prisma Client instance:
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate"

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

2. Apply migrations
Run the following command to create and apply a migration:
npx prisma migrate dev

3. Manage your data
View and edit your data locally by running this command:
npx prisma studio

...or online in Console:
https://console.prisma.io/{workspaceId}/{projectId}/studio

4. Send queries from your app
If you already have an existing app with Prisma ORM, you can now run it and it will send queries against your newly created Prisma Postgres instance.

5. Learn more
For more info, visit the Prisma Postgres docs: https://pris.ly/ppg-docs
```

</details>

Locate and copy the database URL provided in the CLI output. Then, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Now, paste the URL into it as a value for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. For example:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...
```

Run the following command to create tables in your database. This creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Execute the seed file in [`prisma/seed.js`](./prisma/seed.js) to populate your database with some sample data, by running:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Using the REST API

You can also access the REST API of the API server directly. It is running on the same host machine and port and can be accessed via the `/api` route (in this case that is `localhost:3000/api/`, so you can e.g. reach the API with [`localhost:3000/api/feed`](http://localhost:3000/api/feed)).

### `GET`

- `/api/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/api/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/api/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

### `POST`

- `/api/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/api/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

### `PUT`

- `/api/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

### `DELETE`

- `/api/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`

## Switch to another database (e.g. SQLite, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than Postgres, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block.

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### Remove the Prisma Client extension

Before you proceed to use your own database, you should remove the Prisma client extension required for Prisma Postgres:

```terminal
npm uninstall @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

Remove the client extension from your `PrismaClient` instance:

```diff
- const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
+ const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### Your own PostgreSQL database

To use your own PostgreSQL database remove the `@prisma/extension-accelerate` package and remove the Prisma client extension.

### SQLite

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add the SQLite database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db""
```

### MySQL

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add a MySQL database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
## This is a placeholder url
DATABASE_URL="mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add a Microsoft SQL Server database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
## This is a placeholder url
DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
```

### MongoDB

Modify the `provider` value in the `datasource` block in the [`prisma.schema`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Create an `.env` file and add a local MongoDB database connection string in it. For example:

```terminal
## This is a placeholder url
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```
